HELP_MESSAGE = """* `/find` - Search for plants using any criteria. This command returns a limited number of results, with each plant's details sent as a separate message. It's ideal when you want to forward individual plant information.

* `/findall` - Similar to `/find`, but returns all matching plants in a single message. This is great for getting an overview of all plants that meet your search criteria.

* `/plant` or `/uid` - Get detailed information about a specific plant by its unique identifier (UID). Use this when you need in-depth data on a particular plant.

* `/genus_stat` - View statistics about plant genera or species. If you specify a genus name, it will show statistics for species within that genus. This command is useful for understanding the diversity and distribution of your plant collection."""
